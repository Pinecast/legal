# Pinecast Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how your information is handled by Pinecast.

By using Pinecast or any of its services you consent to the use of your personal information as described in this document. Except where noted, your personal information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.

## What we collect

### Your Email

Pinecast may collect your email address in order to create an account, leave feedback on a podcast, or leave a tip. If you are leaving feedback or a tip, your email address will be shared with the owner of the podcast. If you collaborate with other users on Pinecast, your email address may be shared with those users.

Pinecast will not share your email address with its partners or third parties.

You may opt-out of any non-essential communications with Pinecast.

### Information You Give Us

You may provide us with information, like a Slack API URL, to enable a Pinecast feature. This information is not shared unless explicitly stated.

### Information About Your Browser

We use data that your web browser (or other user agent) makes available to us in order to provide you with a better experience. This may include information about which timezone you're located in, your IP address, or which operating system you use. We use this data to improve Pinecast and your user experience. Some data may be used to provide podcast owners with anonymous aggregate information about who accesses or listens to their podcasts.

Your computer's IP address may be processed to determine your rough location.

### How You Use Pinecast

Pinecast will track how you use the service. This includes things like which pages you visit, the actions you perform on those pages, and any errors you may encounter. This information is used to improve Pinecast.

Pinecast will use a cookie to allow you to remain logged in.

Pinecast allows its users to add Google Analytics to their websites (hosted at `*.pinecast.co` or a non-Pinecast domain name). Google Analytics is only available on sites that explicitly enable it. Only Google and the site owner has access to the data collected.

### Financial Data

Pinecast collects credit card information to charge customers for paid subscriptions and to charge listeners for tips. Pinecast also collects bank account details to transfer tip balances to those bank accounts. This data never passes through Pinecast servers; it is transmitted directly from the user's browser to Stripe, our payment processor. Because Pinecast never has access to credit card or bank account information, the information cannot be transmitted to any other third party.

Pinecast does have access to less private information, like the name of a credit card holder or the last few digits of a bank account number. This information may be displayed in the Pinecast user interface, but it is never cached or stored in a database. The information is requested from Stripe when it is needed.

### Imported Podcasts

If you use Pinecast's import tool, Pinecast will download information from the feed you provide us in order to copy that information to our servers. Pinecast keeps records of all imported files, including the original URI. This information is used to improve Pinecast and is not shared with third parties.


## How your information is used

Pinecast will never sell or trade your information with any third party without your direct consent.

Pinecast uses Google Analytics to analyze collected information. Please see Google's privacy policy for more information:

https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/

Pinecast will share information with third parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

- Comply with the law, legal process, or enforceable government request
- Enforce our terms of use
- Protect Pinecast and its services from harm

## How information is protected

- Pinecast avoids storing any data that it does not need.
- Most Pinecast properties are configured to use HTTPS, meaning all data is encrypted in transit.
- Our infrastructure uses industry best practices for storing and securing sensitive information.
