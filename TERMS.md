Anyone who uses Pinecast, whether to produce or consume content or for any other reason, agrees to these Terms. If you do not agree with any of the Terms presented here, you may not use or access Pinecast.

## Content

Pinecast does not actively review or monitor content posted to its infrastructure, nor do we control how content is presented. Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, offensive, unpleasant, or otherwise lacking integrity; this is the sole responsibility of the user that uploads the content. Pinecast is not liable for issues that arise with or because of content posted by users.

When you post content of any type to Pinecast, you grant a non-exclusive license to Pinecast to host the content on Pinecast infrastructure. You also grant a non-exclusive license to any users who access that content. This includes users who may not be registered Pinecast users, and users of third-party websites and services. You own all rights to content that you upload to Pinecast, including the right to remove your content. Content may take an indeterminate amount of time to be fully removed from Pinecast infrastructure. Pinecast may not be able to recover content after deletion.

Before uploading content to Pinecast, you must posess rights to the content you are uploading.

Pinecast may remove any uploaded content at any time and for any reason.

## Accounts

You are not required to create an account with Pinecast. Creating an account, however, grants access to certain features that are not available to users without accounts. You will be required to provide a valid email address for use with your Pinecast account. You must own and maintain control of the email address provided to Pinecast.

The security and confidentiality of your account is your own responsibility. Any actions performed through your account--regardless of whether you authorized them--are your own responsibility.

Pinecast reserves the right to terminate or throttle any account at any time for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, abuse of service limits or using--at our sole discretion--excessive infrastructure resources. Pinecast also reserves the right to access any account information. This may be to investigate or address problems with our service, satisfy legal requirements or requests by governments, or to protect ourselves or our users.

If we remove or disable access to content in response to a notice of infringement, we will do our best to contact the user who posted the infringing content. You may respond to such a notice if you believe the content is not infringing. When you respond, you must provide enough information to enable Pinecast to make a reasonable determination. If you materially misrepresent that the content is not infringing, you may be held accountable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees).
